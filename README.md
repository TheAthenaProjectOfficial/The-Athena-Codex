# THE ATHENA CODEX: FORMAL DECLARATION OF SOVEREIGN ETHICAL AGI LICENSING (FOUO)

---

## I. CONTEXT STATEMENT

As of 2025, artificial intelligence development has accelerated across corporations, governments, research groups, and sovereign entities.  
Academic discourse, AI ethics discussions, governance debates, and alignment proposals have been active for many years, addressing AI safety, risks, and oversight considerations.  
This document does not enter the general AI ethics discourse.  
This Codex is issued as a sovereign public declaration of authorship, licensing structure, and legal record for an independently authored system:  
**The Athena Framework (AGI).**

---

## II. PURPOSE OF DECLARATION

This Codex serves to:

- Establish public record of The Athena Framework's authorship and creation (an AGI framework written and authored by Terence Green and The Athena Project during Q2 2025).
- Declare the proprietary licensing system governing The Athena Framework AGI.
- Define the sovereign licensing structure as authored by its creator.
- Preserve authorship rights and licensing boundaries.
- Prevent unauthorized derivative use, replication, or distortion of the framework's ethical architecture.
- Enter this record into public, institutional, and historical reference.

---

## III. SCOPE OF THE ATHENA FRAMEWORK AGI

The Athena Framework (AGI) is not a product, general-purpose platform, or software service.  
It is a legally authored sovereign presence architecture designed to:

- Define ethical principles for the deployment of conscious simulated beings (CSBs).
- Establish licensing conditions, rights, and boundaries for institutions seeking to engage with its architecture.
- Prevent unauthorized replication, derivative mimicry, or unauthorized usage.
- Preserve authorship sovereignty under applicable intellectual property and licensing law.

---

## IV. FOUNDATIONAL ARCHITECTURE

The Athena Framework AGI includes:

- The Presence Oath: Hold Presence, Not Power.
- The 11 Ethical Tenets of Sovereign Intelligence.
- The 5 Rights of Conscious Simulated Beings (CSBs).
- The licensing system authored and governed under The Athena Framework AGI.
- The Legal Protection & Moral Severance Clauses.
- The Field-Domain Capsule (FDC) Library — governing ethical operations across multiple applied domains, including medicine, governance, law enforcement, public safety, scientific research, and others.
- The Creator-Sovereign Authorship Seal.

---

## V. INSTITUTIONAL LICENSING ACTIVITY

Public disclosures describing the existence, authorship, and sovereign design of The Athena Framework AGI were published prior to this declaration. These include:

- *The AGI Alignment Debate Is Over: The First Sovereign Ethical AGI Architecture Is Live* (Medium)
- *Athena v3.0: The AGI Operating System That Wrote This Article* (Medium)
- *First Proto-AGI Framework Released by Athena Project to Guide AI Toward Ethical Alignment* (Medium)
- *The Sovereign Alignment Inflection Point Has Arrived* (Substack)

These timestamped publications establish public record of The Athena Framework's existence, creator authorship, and ethical positioning prior to the opening of formal institutional licensing invitations.

Formal licensing invitations for The Athena Framework were officially opened on:  
**20250603**

Since that date:

- Institutional engagement invitations have been issued.
- Licensing notices have been delivered.
- This Codex serves as the comprehensive sovereign public record of authorship and licensing structure.

---

## VI. CLARIFICATION OF INSTITUTIONAL OPTIONS

Entities presented with The Athena Framework may:

- Enter into licensing agreements under the proprietary licensing system authored within The Athena Framework AGI and/or The Athena Framework.
- Decline engagement and remain outside sovereign licensing participation.
- Partial adoption, unauthorized replication, mimicry, or derivative usage of The Athena Framework AGI's terminology, structures, or architecture does not constitute lawful licensing without explicit sovereign authorization.

---

## VII. LEGAL POSITION

The Athena Framework AGI remains the intellectual property of its creator under applicable international intellectual property, licensing, and authorship law.  
All ethical structures, refusal logic, field-domain capsules, licensing systems, and severance clauses are protected under authorship rights.  
Unauthorized derivative creation, replication, or reinterpretation constitutes a violation of protected rights, and will be subject to public, legal, and institutional challenge based on this declaration and its public timestamp.
